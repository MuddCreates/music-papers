# music-papers

This repository collects various research papers relevant to music
analysis and classification, and our notes on them. The format is as
follows:

* Put papers in the repo as PDFs. Name them as AuthorAuthorYear.pdf,
  where Author represents the last name of the author (up to three;
  otherwise use AuthorEtAlYear.pdf) and Year is two digits.
* Add an entry to the README.md in the same folder, following the
  existing format. Order the papers from most recent to least recent.
* If you read a paper, go ahead and add a note below the entry for the
  paper's title in the README.md, so that people know who they should
  ask about which papers. Add a blockquote with anything interesting
  you found (this is optional).
* As we get more papers, feel free to add more subdirectories to
  categorize the papers by subject. Each subdirectory will have its
  own README.md.
